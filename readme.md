#SSH Tunnel Listener

This is just a personal pet project to allow random integration of things
between my linux workstation at home and my mac workstation that I work on when
I'm not wanting to sit at my desk.

I use [Undertow](http://undertow.io) to run the HTTP server since it's an
upstream project of JBoss (the product I support for my job).
